# Hi, I'm Rojesh Dhakal ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Data Analyst** and aspiring **Data Scientist** specializing in **fintech**, **cloud computing**, and **machine learning**. Currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in **FinTech and Investment Management** at **Lincoln University**, I focus on leveraging **data analysis**, **portfolio optimization**, and **reinforcement learning** to solve complex financial problems.

## ðŸ”­ Currently Working On
- **Stock Market Prediction**: Building and optimizing machine learning models to predict stock market trends, including using **LSTM** and **ARIMA** for time series forecasting.
- **Investment Portfolio Optimization**: Analyzing asset performance, including **TESLA**, and utilizing techniques like **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**, **CAPM**, and **Black-Litterman** to enhance risk-return optimization in portfolios.
- **Cloud-Based Infrastructure**: Developing secure and scalable cloud infrastructure for efficient data storage and analysis using **AWS**, **SAMBA**, and **EFS**.
- **Predictive Financial Modeling**: Building models to predict stock market indices like **NZX 50**, informed by movements in major indices such as **S&P 500** and **ASX 200**.

## ðŸŒ± Continuous Learning & Development
- Expanding my expertise in **time series forecasting** and deep learning techniques (**LSTM**, **ARIMA**) for financial data.
- Enhancing knowledge in **portfolio optimization** strategies and **financial algorithms** to create more effective investment solutions.
- Exploring **risk management** approaches and **quantitative analysis** methods to improve financial decision-making and forecasting.
  
## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

- **[Investment Analysis: TESLA Portfolio Impact](https://github.com/RojeshDhakal/Investment-Analysis)**: Evaluating my current US portfolio, with advanced financial models like **CAPM**, **MPT**, and **LSTM** to optimize risk and return.
- **[Supervised Learning: Predicting NZX 50](https://github.com/RojeshDhakal/NZX-VS-ASX-VS-SP500)**: Predicting the **NZX 50** index using machine learning algorithms trained on movements from the **S&P 500** and **ASX 200**.
- **[Customer Churn Prediction (Kiwibank)](https://github.com/RojeshDhakal/Customer-Churn-KiwiBank)**: Implementing neural networks to forecast customer retention and churn at **Kiwibank**, aiming to enhance customer lifetime value.

## ðŸ”¥ Skills & Tools

- **Programming Languages**: **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
- **Cloud Computing**: **AWS** (EC2, VPC, Lambda, SageMaker)
- **Machine Learning**: **MLP**, **LSTM**, **ARIMA**, **Neural Networks**
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
