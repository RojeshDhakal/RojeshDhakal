# Hi, I'm Rojesh Dhakal ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst and aspiring data scientist with a focus on **fintech**, **cloud computing**, and **machine learning**. Currently pursuing a Master's in FinTech and Investment Management at Lincoln University. I specialize in **data analysis**, **portfolio optimization**, and **reinforcement learning**.

## ðŸ”­ Currently Working On
- Building and optimizing machine learning models to predict stock market trends and portfolio allocation.
- Developing cloud-based infrastructure for secure and efficient data storage and analysis (AWS, SAMBA, EFS).
- Exploring reinforcement learning techniques through AWS DeepRacer.

## ðŸŒ± Learning & Improving
- Delving deeper into time series forecasting using LSTM and ARIMA models for financial data.
- Enhancing my understanding of optimization techniques for portfolio management.
